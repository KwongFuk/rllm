Since the products of each of the three rows are equal, these products are equal to $\\sqrt[3]{2^{9} \\times 5^{9}}=2^{3} \\times 5^{3}$. So the 'magic product' is 1000 .  By considering the top row, we can see that the top right cell must contain $1000 \\div(20 \\times 1)=50$.  The only other way to get 1000 as the product of 1 and two of the remaining numbers is $1 \\times 10 \\times 100$. So 10 and 100 must fill the two spaces below 1 . We cannot put the 100 in the centre since the products of the numbers on each diagonal would then be too large. So 10 goes in the centre and 100 below it. From the diagonal we see that the bottom right entry is 5 and so the middle number on the right is 4.
